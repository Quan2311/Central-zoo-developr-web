    <h2>Characteristics of Red Pandas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Size: Red Pandas are about the size of a domestic cat, with a body length of 50-65 cm (20-26 in) and a tail length of 30-50 cm (12-20 in).</li>
      <li>Appearance: Red Pandas have reddish-brown fur on their backs and black fur on their legs, tails, and faces. They also have distinctive white markings on their faces and ears.</li>
      <li>Diet: Red Pandas are omnivores, and their diet consists mainly of bamboo leaves and shoots. They also eat fruit, insects, and small animals.</li>
      <li>Behavior: Red Pandas are solitary animals, and are most active during the day. They are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees. They also have a unique adaptation in their wrist bones, which allows them to grip bamboo stalks more efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Red Pandas are currently classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN, meaning that they are at high risk of extinction in the wild. Their populations are threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and fragmentation, as well as poaching for their fur and body parts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these animals and their habitats.</p>
